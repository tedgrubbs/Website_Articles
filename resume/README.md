[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sc932/resume.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sc932/resume)

This is my resume (and CV) in LaTeX

This resume is based off a template I found a few years ago, which was a modified template, see the (C) list at the top for a history.

I have also included the original templates (along the path to my resume).

Feel free to fork and edit.

In linux run
```bash
$ pdflatex resumeName.tex
```
This should result in the creation of ``resumeName.pdf``

Ubuntu requirements:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra
```
